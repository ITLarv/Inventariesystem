# Stuff that is left to do
* Change lineEdits to comboboxes to be able to use [suggestions before typing.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67891112/how-to-display-all-suggestions-before-typing-anything-in-pyqt5-tablewidget)
* GUI for lokal init
* Auto scaling of window [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41331201/pyqt-5-and-4k-screen)
###Problem with autoscaling is for the version of pyqt5? It gives a error that is mentioned in the comments of first answer

* Make the code readable - some code splitting and rewriting
* Make the code run faster by removing stuff in the pyqt5 file (Starts faster)
* Make it possible to one-click the extra furniture part, so like adding to the list and then confirm with one button.
* right way of error handeling. All commands should return -1 if there was a error. It should also have specifik returns depending on the error. -1 is the general error. This should also include lexikon for all the error codes - in the docs. Or rais error idk
* Set new names on stuff, and use namingconventions right. All functions and variables should be names in the same way.
* Write docs for the code
* Remove all code that had with the update button to do, if any left
* Generalize the get all functions
* Storage should be generalized
* Initial display screen should be same layout as active display (search companies and gods)
* Palldragare is called storage right now? Something should be changed (buttons.py)
